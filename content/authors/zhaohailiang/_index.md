Currently I am a ZJU 100 Young Professor (百人计划研究员) in the School of Software Technology, Zhejiang University (ZJU). I obtained my PhD in the College of Computer Science and Technology at ZJU in 2024, supervised by Prof. Shuiguang Deng (国家杰青、浙大求是特聘学者). From Sep. 2022 to Sep. 2023, I was a visiting research scholar of PDCL Lab, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), very luckily to be advised by Prof. Xueyan Tang. I am fortunate to work with Prof. Zomaya (IEEE Fellow) at University of Sydney, Australia and Prof. Dustdar (IEEE Fellow) at TU Wien, Austria.
